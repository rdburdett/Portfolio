        I am currently based in the midwest and I am actively seeking software engineering work. I am most interested in remote work, but would be willing to move anywhere for the right fit.

      <p>
        A born tinkerer, I have always loved taking things apart to see how they worked and how they could be improved (much to my mother's dismay when she, for example, would come home to find the VCR in pieces on the living room floor). I come from a family of physicians, so professionally, it was natural for me to go in the direction of healthcare. However, I've always had a strong pull to move into tech.
      </p>
      <p>
        After several grueling years of travel nursing while self-studying coding, and the decision to join Thinkful's software development bootcamp, I now feel equipped with a skill set that can take my work in a new direction. Though healthcare has been incredibly fulfilling, I'm excited to pivot to a new facet of my career and move into the tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I love to travel, play guitar, and create electronic music.
